# Side-Event-Loop

## Simple event loop created in the C++

This project is created for educational purposes.

I wanted to create a project in C ++. But I wanted it to be a multithreading application. That's why I decided to write my own C ++ event loop as a shared library.

Thanks to this, I will get to know the concepts of multithreading in practice and create an event loop library for my future C ++ projects.
